Quickflick

This feature proposal allows the user to flick quickly back and forth through their
browsing history. The action of flicking is performed using CTRL+ALT and the left and right
arrow buttons.

A 'flick' consists of the item in history sliding in from the left of the screen (back) or
the right of the screen (forward). Once the user has found the page in their history they
wish to nagivate to, they release the CTRL+ALT keys and Arora loads that page.

The approach has a number of advantages over conventional history navigation:

  - The user can visually identify the page they are loading from history before nagivating to it.
    This is more intuitive and reliable than identifying the page from the url/title.
  - Navigating several pages back in the history is less time-consuming.
  - When completing multi-page forms the user can review their input on previous pages without interrupting work
    on the current page.

Arora is a cross platform web browser built using Qt and WebKit.


Building:
Arora uses the qmake build system.  If you already have Qt 4.5 or newer on your system building is as easy as running the command 'qmake' and then 'make' or 'nmake' on Windows.
